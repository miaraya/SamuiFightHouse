								<span>The art of eigth limbs</span>
							</div>

							<p class="t300">Dating back to the 16th century, Muay Thai is an important part of Thailand’s culture and one of the most effective ways to get fit and develop self-confidence. This physical and mental discipline, which includes combat on foot, is known as “the art of the eight limbs” because it is characterised by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees and feet. It is this intensive physical preparation that makes the full-contact fighter so efficient. </p>
							<p class="t300">As one of the leading farang Muay Thai fighters of all time, Sean offers a unique opportunity to learn about the “Art of Eight Limbs” in a safe, relaxed and painless way.</p>

								<h3>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h3>

							</div>

			
							<p class="t300">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art, combat sport and self defense system that focuses on grappling and especially ground based fighting.  BJJ was created from Kodokan Judoground fighting (Ne-Waza) fundamentals that were taught to Luiz Franca and Carlos Gracie by mast Misuyo Maeda.  BJJ eventually became its own art via the experimentation and adaptations undertaken by Carlos and Helio Gracie who shared this new knowledge with their extended family and then the wider world.

							</div>
		
							<p class="t300">
							MMA is a full contact combat sport which allows the use of both striking and grappling techniques, whether standing or on the ground.  MMA originated as a competition with the intent to determine which martial art was the most effective for unarmed combat. As such competitors were pitted against each other with very few rules, which is pretty much how the sport is still conducted today.

							<p class="t300">
								The pyramid for success for a fighter includes training, rest and nutrition. Many fighters put 100% into their training and ensure proper rest between sessions to aid optimal recovery, but fall down when it comes to the nutritional component due to a lack of knowledge or planning. The Fight House's Private Chef can create a customised programme for you; whether your goal is to lose weight, maintain weight or gain muscle mass, our Chef is here to help you recover from your training. Nutritional advice, prepared meals and complete meal plans to ensure you continue eating healthily when you return home are all available to help you reach your personal goals.
